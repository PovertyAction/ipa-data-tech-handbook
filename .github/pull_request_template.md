| ⭐⭐⭐  |  `:star: :star: :star:`     | Important to fix before PR can be approved... <br /><br /> And I am providing reasons why it needs to be addressed as well as suggested improvements.           |
| ⭐⭐    |  `:star: :star:`            | Important to fix but non-blocking for PR approval... <br /><br /> And I am providing suggestions where it could be improved either in this PR or later.         |
| ⭐       |  `:star:`                  | Give this some thought but non-blocking for PR approval... <br /><br /> ...and consider this a suggestion, not a requirement.                                    |
| ❓  | `:question:` | I have a question. <br /><br /> This should be a fully formed question with sufficient information and context that requires a response.                                            |

|  ⛏  |   `:pick:`   | This is a nitpick. <br /><br /> This does not require any changes and is often better left unsaid. This may include stylistic, formatting, or organization suggestions and should likely be prevented/enforced by linting if they really matter |
