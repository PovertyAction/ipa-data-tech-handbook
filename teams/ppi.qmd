The Poverty Probability Index (PPI®) is a poverty measurement tool for organizations and
businesses with a mission to serve the poor. The PPI is statistically-sound, yet simple
to use: the answers to 10 questions about a household’s characteristics and asset
ownership are scored to compute the likelihood that the household is living below the
poverty line. With the PPI, organizations can identify the clients, customers, or
employees who are most likely to be poor, integrating objective poverty data into their
assessments and strategic decision-making.

The PPI is currently housed at Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA).
