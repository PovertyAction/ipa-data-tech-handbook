## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that allows you to track changes in your
codebase. It is widely used in software development to manage code changes and
collaborate with other people working on or learning from the shared codebase.

## How to install Git?

Install [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) via `winget`. Git comes
pre-installed with MacOS and Linux, if you can't find it, try installing with Homebrew.

| Platform | Commands                 |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| Windows  | `winget install Git.Git` |
| MacOS    | `git --version`          |
| Linux    | `git --version`          |

## Using Git

Git can be confusing and overwhelming. We recommend starting with a graphical user
interface (GUI) to help you understand the basics of Git. GitHub Desktop is a good
option or, if you use VS Code, you can use the built-in Git functionality (See
[VS Code documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git)).

[![Basic Git Commands](https://github.blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/GitHub-for-beginners.png?resize=1600%2C840)](https://youtu.be/rE2zRhZdjFU?si=8Mdt6BjH5F7truAq))

Here are the basic commands you need to know to get started with Git:

### `git init`

Create a new Git repository

```bash
git init
```

### `git clone`

Clone a repository into a new directory For example, to clone the IPA handbook
repository:

```bash
# If using HTTPS
git clone https://github.com/PovertyAction/ipa-data-tech-handbook.git

# If using SSH
git clone git@github.com:PovertyAction/ipa-data-tech-handbook.git
```

### `git checkout`

Branches are used to develop new code or modify existing code such that the "main" code
is not affected until the new code is ready. To create a new branch, use:

```bash
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

This checks out a new branch called `new-branch-name`. To switch back to the main
branch, use:

```bash
git checkout main
```

To checkout a branch from the remote repository, use:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout --track origin/remote-branch-name
```

To push a branch to the remote repository, use:

```bash
git push origin new-branch-name
```

To delete a branch, use:

```bash
git branch -d new-branch-name
```

List all local branches:

```bash
git branch --list
```

### `git add`

Add files that have changed and are ready to be committed to the staging area. To add a
file, `file_name.md`, use:

```bash
git add file_name.md
```

### `git commit`

Commit changes to the checked out branch.

Good commit messages follow the following format:

```bash
git commit -m "<type>: <description>"
```

To commit changes with a message, use:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: adding new feature to the codebase"
```

### `git push`

Send changes to the remote repository. To push any commits to remote use the following:

```bash
git push origin new-branch-name
```

If you are pushing a new branch to the remote repository, use:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin new-branch-name
```

Consider adding the
[Conventional Commits](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits)
extension to your VS Code to help you write good commit messages.

## Best Practices

1. Always include a README file in your repository and keep it up to date with key
   information that anyone who visits your repository should know for using,
   replicating, or contributing to code in the repository.
1. Use branches to develop new features or fix bugs. This helps to keep the main branch
   clean and stable.
1. Write clear and concise commit messages. A good commit message should describe what
   changes were made and why they were made. Refer to
   [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for
   good practice in writing commit messages.
1. Push changes to the remote repository frequently. This helps to keep your codebase up
   to date and allows others to collaborate with you.
1. Use pull requests to propose changes to the main branch. Try to keep the pull request
   small such that there is a manageable amount of code to review.
