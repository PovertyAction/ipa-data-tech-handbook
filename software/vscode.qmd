## What is Visual Studio Code?

Visual Studio Code, often referred to as "VS Code", is a software tool for writing,
editing, and developing text-based documents and programs. At IPA, we use a variety of
tools for editing documents and writing code. However, we recommend using VS Code as a
standard ecosystem for working on collaborative code-first data and technology projects.
You may be more comfortable working with other tools like `Stata Do File Editor`,
`RStudio` for `R`, or `Jupyter Notebooks`. We encourage you to work with the tools that
you are most comfortable with. However, VS Code provides a common ecosystem for
source-controlled, collaborative, polyglot development of data and technology solutions.
We encourage IPA teams to contribute to this documentation in order to share best
practices and useful settings or extensions.

## How to Install VS Code?

To install VS Code, download and install the latest software version from the Visual
Studio Code [website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or run the following from the
command line if you have the Windows Package Manager, `winget`, installed:

| Platform | Commands                                    |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Windows  | `winget install Microsoft.VisualStudioCode` |
| MacOS    | `brew install --cask visual-studio-code`    |
| Linux    | `sudo snap install code --classic`          |
