## What is a Justfile?

[Just](https://just.systems/man/en/) is a command runner that can be used to define and
run common command line actions that we run to set up the computing environment and
build the assets of a project.

The `Justfile` is how we write "recipes" of commands that we plan to run repetitively.
You are encourage to set up, use, and add to the `Justfile` to make your work more
efficient. This will help yourself and your colleagues know how to run common tasks that
are needed to work within a project's codebase.
