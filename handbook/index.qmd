Welcome to IPA's Handbook for Data and Technology!

::: {.callout-caution}
## This handbook is an early work in progress

## About the Handbook

This handbook is intended as a living document to assist IPA staff and collaborators
with common practices for writing code and working with data. The handbook will
never be comprehensive of every possible software, data object, or shared practice.
However, IPA staff working with data and technology are encouraged to use this
handbook as a reference and a shared project to give tips and advice for working
collaboratively with data analysis and software development.


## How to use the Handbook

Eventually we will have a long-term home for this document. Until then, the best
way to read the document is to build the handbook locally on your computer and view
in a browser.

## Build the Handbook

Note that building the handbook from source code requires the following to be
installed on your local computer (see [Computer Setup](setup.qmd) for more information
about software installation):

- `winget` (Windows) or `homebrew` (MacOS/Linux) for package management and installation
- `git` for source control management
- `just` for running common command line patterns
- `rye` for installing Python and managing virtual environments

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}

## Windows

```{bash}
winget install Git.Git Casey.Just Rye.Rye
```

## Linux
```{bash}
brew install just rye
```

## MacOS
```{bash}
brew install just rye
```

:::

As a shortcut, if you already have `Just` installed, you can run the following
to install required software and build a python virtual environment that is
used to build the handbook pages:

```{bash}
just get-started
```

## Preview the handbook

To build a version of the Handbook so that you can read it on your computer, run
the following from a Terminal. Make sure that you are working from the root folder
of this Git Repository:

```{bash}
just preview-docs
```

The command line above references the `_quarto.yml` file and creates the
`.html` files for the handbook then launches a browser window with a `localhost`
server of the handbook.

## Contributing to the Handbook

You can contribute to this Handbook in a number of ways:

1. File an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/PovertyAction/ipa_data_tech_handbook/issues/new)
  with recommended additions or edits.
2. Edit pages of the Handbook on GitHub by clicking on the "Edit this page" link
  on any page of the Handbook.

3. Edit the code locally on your computer using git

```{bash}
git clone git@github.com:PovertyAction/dse_handbook.git
```

You are also encouraged to have Git installed so that you can edit the source code
and make contributions.

## Windows

```{bash}
winget install GitHub.GitHubDesktop
```

## Linux

Git is pre-installed with Linux and GitHub Desktop not available for Linux.

## MacOS

Git is pre-installed with MacOS. If you want to install GitHub Desktop run:
```{bash}
brew install --cask github
```
