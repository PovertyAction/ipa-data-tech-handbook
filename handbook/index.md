Welcome to IPA's Handbook for Data and Technology!

> \[!WARNING\] This handbook is an early work in progress

## About the Handbook

This handbook is intended as a living document to assist IPA staff and collaborators
with common practices for writing code and working with data. The handbook will never be
comprehensive of every possible software, data object, or shared practice. However, IPA
staff working with data and technology are encouraged to use this handbook as a
reference and a shared project to give tips and advice for working collaboratively with
data analysis and software development.

## How to use the Handbook

Eventually we will have a long-term home for this document. Until then, the best way to
read the document is to build the handbook locally on your computer and view in a
browser.
