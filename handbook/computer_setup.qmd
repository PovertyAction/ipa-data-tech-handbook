Refer to the Global Help Desk for general guidance on IPA software and account
access.

This page is meant to help guide you in setting up your laptop with common software
used by data and technology teams at IPA. Most software covered in this page have
their own page in this handbook. We encourage you to refer to for usage of each
software. And please contribute to those pages so that others at IPA (including
your future self) are able to learn about what works well for interacting with
data at IPA.

## Package Manager

A package manager helps to standardize how you install and update software on
your computer. Generally, you want to use a package manager to install any programs
that are used globally on your computer. By "globally", we mean that it is a program
that is used across many projects and computing environments.

If using a Windows computer with Windows 10 or later, we encourage you to use the
Windows Package Manager, [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/).

::: {.callout-caution collapse="true"}
## Checking to see if you have winget

- Open Windows Powershell (See [PowerShell 101](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/learn/ps101/01-getting-started) if new to Windows PowerShell)

- Check to see if you have `winget` installed:
![Winget Version](images/software/winget-version.png)

- If you do not see a version number for `winget`. Follow the Microsoft instructions
  to [Install winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/#install-winget)

:::

On MacOS, it is recommended that you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) as
a package manager. On Linux you can use Homebrew or [Snap](https://snapcraft.io/).
This may be relevant if you are working in the [Windows Subsystem Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) (WSL).

The following command line examples can be use to install the majority of the
software covered in this Handbook. Note that there are some exceptions to software
available via a package manager. For example, Stata needs to be installed via
the [installation packages](https://ipastorage.app.box.com/folder/129276324764?v=install-stata) provided by IPA on Box.

## Windows

```{bash}
# Install a single program (e.g. GitHub for command line)
winget install GitHub.cli

# Install multiple programs (Just, Rye for Python)
winget install Casey.Just Rye.Rye

# Some additional programs that may be helpful to install globally

# Windows Terminal
winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal

# Microsoft PowerToys
winget install Microsoft.PowerToys

# GitHub CLI for interacting with GitHub from the command line
winget install GitHub.GithubDesktop

# Install Quarto
winget install Posit.Quarto

```

## Linux
```{bash}
# Install a single program (e.g. GitHub for command line)
brew install gh

# Install multiple programs (Just, Rye for Python)
brew install just rye

# Some additional programs that may be helpful to install globally

# Visual Studio Code
# See installation instructions here: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux
sudo snap install code --classic

# Install Quarto
# download and install from https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
# for example for verison v1.4.554, run:

:::

If using Windows 10 or 11, we recommend `winget`. However, if you do not have
Windows 10+, you can achieve a similar package management experience with either
[chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [scoop](https://scoop.sh/).

## Terminal

In Windows, we recommend using the [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).
However, there are several other options for terminals. Select what you feel most
comfortable with. The same is true for MacOS and Linux where there are many Terminal
options to select from.

## Shell

You are free to choose whichever shell works best for your workflow and style.
Here are the common shell options for Windows users:

### bash

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}

## Windows

Git Bash is included with the [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) installation.

```{bash}
# Install git for Windows
winget install Git.Git
```

## MacOS
Bash comes pre-installed with MacOS, but run the following if it is not available:

```{bash}
brew install bash
```

## Linux
Bash comes pre-installed with Linux, but run the following if it is not available:

```{bash}
brew install bash
```

:::


### Nushell

[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) is a cross operating system shell with a data
pipeline focus.

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}

## Windows
```{bash}
# Install Nushell
winget install Nushell.Nushell
```

## MacOS
```{bash}
# Install Nushell
brew install nu
```

## Linux
```{bash}
# Install Nushell
brew install nu
```

:::

If using VS Code, it's highly recommended that you install the [Nushell Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheNuProjectContributors.vscode-nushell-lang).

### Windows PowerShell

[Windows PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/overview)
is often the default shell on Windows.

::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}

## Windows
```{bash}
# install or upgrade PowerShell
winget install --id Microsoft.PowerShell -e
```

## MacOS

```{bash}
brew install powershell/tap/powershell
```

## Linux

See [installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/install-ubuntu)

:::


Optionally, you can install [Starship](https://starship.rs/) for shell prompt customization.


::: {.panel-tabset group="os"}

## Windows

```{bash}
# Install Scoop
irm get.scoop.sh -outfile 'scoop_install.ps1'
powershell -File scoop_install.ps1
scoop update --all

# install Nerd Fonts of your choice, e.g. CascadiaMono-NF, https://www.nerdfonts.com/
scoop bucket add nerd-fonts
scoop install nerd-fonts/CascadiaMono-NF

# install Starship
winget install Starship.Starship
```

## MacOS

```{bash}
# install Nerd Fonts of your choice, e.g. CascadiaMono-NF, https://www.nerdfonts.com/
brew install --cask font-cascadia-mono-nf

# install Starship
brew install starship
```

## Linux

```{bash}
# Download Nerd Fonts of your choice, e.g. CascadiaMono-NF, https://www.nerdfonts.com/
wget https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.2.1/CascadiaCode.zip
# install Nerd Fonts
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/fonts/
unzip CascadiaCode.zip -d ~/.local/share/fonts/CascadiaCode
fc-cache -f -v

# install Starship
brew install starship
```

:::

Follow the starship [installation instructions](https://starship.rs/#quick-install) for using starship with your preferred shell, for example, if using Nushell, run:

```{bash}
mkdir ~/.cache/starship
starship init nu | save -f ~/.cache/starship/init.nu
```

You can set the Starship configuration to your liking in a `~/.config/starship.toml`
file. For example you could use the `jetpack` preset configuration by running:

```{bash}
# starship configuration
mkdir ~/.config
starship preset jetpack -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```
