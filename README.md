## About the Handbook

This handbook is intended as a living document to assist IPA staff and collaborators
with common practices for writing code and working with data. The handbook will never be
comprehensive of every possible software, data object, or shared practice. However, IPA
staff working with data and technology are encouraged to use this handbook as a
reference and a shared project to give tips and advice for working collaboratively with
data analysis and software development.

This repository is also intended as a reference for how to develop code that aligns
with best practices for software development. While the repository does not cover
all possible applications, software, or scenarios, the nature of this repository is
such that it should grow and improve to address the common work patterns that IPA
uses for writing source code for data science, engineering, and infrastructure
management.
