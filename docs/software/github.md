## What is GitHub?

## How to install GitHub Software?

There are two main options to consider for interacting with GitHub from your local
computer:

1. [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop)
1. [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli)

If you are new to Git or prefer working with a graphical user interface (GUI), we
recommend that you start with GitHub Desktop. The Desktop interface provides a more
transparent way of understanding source control and interacting with remote codebases on
GitHub.

```bash
# Windows
# Install GitHub Desktop
winget install GitHub.GithubDesktop
# Install GitHub CLI
winget install GitHub.cli

# Linux
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh
# MacOS
# Install GitHub Desktop
brew install  --cask github
# Install GitHub CLI
brew install gh
```
