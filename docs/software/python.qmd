## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in data
science, machine learning, and web development. It has a large standard library and a
vibrant community that provides a wide range of libraries and tools for various
applications. As such, Python provides a general-purpose ecosystem that can be used for
a wide range of applications.

## How to install Python?

There are many ways to install Python. We recommend using Python in a virtual
environment to avoid conflicts with other Python installations on your system.

We recommend using a [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) or [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/).
Both of these tools provide a simple way to create and manage Python virtual
environments.

In both cases, you can manage the python packages that are installed in the virtual
environment using a `pyproject.toml` file. See the pyproject.toml example in this
repository for an example of how to manage Python packages. To add package dependencies
to the virtual environment, using `rye`, you can run:

We'll use `rye` to demonstrate how to manage a Python virtual environment. Watch the
following video for a quick introduction to `rye`:

{{\< video https://youtu.be/q99TYA7LnuA >}}

First, install `rye` using `winget` (Windows) or `brew` (MacOS/Linux):

| Platform | Commands             |
| -------- | -------------------- |
| Windows  | `winget install rye` |
| MacOS    | `brew install rye`   |
| Linux    | `brew install rye`   |

Add libraries to the virtual environment using `rye add ...`:

```{python}
# | eval: false
> rye add jupyterlab pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Coding Conventions

We highly recommend working with a [virtual environment](../guides/venv.md) to manage
Python dependencies. The `pyproject.toml` is the preferred way to keep track of python
dependencies as well as project-specific python conventions.

We recommend using [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to enforce
[linting](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)>) and formatting rules. In most
cases you can use the default linting and formatting rules provided by `ruff`. However,
you can customize the rules by modifying the `[tool.ruff]` section of the
`pyproject.toml` file in the root of your project. for more about the configuration
options, see the [Ruff documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/configuration/).

If you are working in a virtual environment created by `rye`, you automatically have
access to `Ruff via  `rye lint`and`rye fmt\` commands to lint and format your code.

## Example Usage

Let's load an example World Bank data via [Gapminder](https://www.gapminder.org/) using
the [causaldata](https://github.com/NickCH-K/causaldata) package.

```{python}
# | eval: true
# | echo: true
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import statsmodels.formula.api as sm
from causaldata import gapminder
```

Load the Gapminder data as a pandas DataFrame:

```{python}
# | echo: true
df = gapminder.load_pandas().data
```

We can check the dimensions of the DataFrame using `df.info()`:

```{python}
# | echo: true
df.info()
```

Let's take a look at the first few rows of the DataFrame using `df.head()`:

```{python}
df.head()
```

Take a look at the relationship between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy:

```{python}
sns.scatterplot(x="gdpPercap", y="lifeExp", hue="continent", data=df).set(
    xscale="log", ylabel="Life Expectancy", xlabel="GDP per Capita"
)
```

Separate the data by year, focusing on 1957 and 2007:

```{python}
sns.relplot(
    data=df.where(df["year"].isin([1957, 2007])),
    x="gdpPercap",
    y="lifeExp",
    col="year",
    hue="continent",
    col_wrap=1,
    kind="scatter",
    palette="muted",
).set(xscale="log", ylabel="Life Expectancy", xlabel="GDP per Capita")
```
