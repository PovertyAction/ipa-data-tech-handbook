## What is Python?
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used
in data science, machine learning, and web development. It has a large standard
library and a vibrant community that provides a wide range of libraries and
tools for various applications. As such, Python provides a general-purpose
ecosystem that can be used for a wide range of applications.

## How to install Python?
There are many ways to install Python. We recommend using Python in a virtual
environment to avoid conflicts with other Python installations on your system.

We recommend using a [rye](https://rye.astral.sh/) or [pixi](https://pixi.sh/latest/).
Both of these tools provide a simple way to create and manage Python virtual
environments.

In both cases, you can manage the python packages that are installed in the
virtual environment using a `pyproject.toml` file. See the pyproject.toml
example in this repository for an example of how to manage Python packages.
To add package dependencies to the virtual environment, using `rye`, you can run:

We'll use `rye` to demonstrate how to manage a Python virtual environment. Watch
the following video for a quick introduction to `rye`:

{{< video https://youtu.be/q99TYA7LnuA >}}

First, install `rye` using `winget` (Windows) or `brew` (MacOS/Linux):

```{python}
# | eval: false
# Windows
> winget install rye

# MacOS/Linux
> brew install rye
```



Add libraries to the virtual environment using `rye add ...`:

```{python}
# | eval: false
> rye add jupyterlab pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

Download data from the a URL:
```{python}
# | eval: true
from urllib.request import urlretrieve

_ = urlretrieve(
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv",
    "../assets/data/penguins.csv",
)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("../assets/data/penguins.csv")
```


```{python label=fig-bill-sizes, fig-cap="Bill Sizes by Species"}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # noqa: E402
import seaborn as sns  # noqa: E402

g = sns.FacetGrid(df, hue="species", height=3, aspect=1.5)
g.map(plt.scatter, "bill_length_mm", "bill_depth_mm").add_legend()
```
