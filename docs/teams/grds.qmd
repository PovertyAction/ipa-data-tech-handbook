IPA's Global Research and Data Support team is known as "GRDS", pronounced like
"guards."

Our team does three main things to support IPA's hundreds of research projects around
the world:

1. Build research resources and technical tools.
1. Provide staff training programs, both in-person and online.
1. Provide direct support to projects, both standard troubleshooting and hourly-rate
   coding services.

See the [GRDS Team Portal](https://sites.google.com/poverty-action.org/grds/home) for
more details about GRDS.
