The Data Science and Engineering (DSE) team strives to be recognized as a knowledge
source in data science for evidence based policy.

In order to achieve this vision, DSE will establish itself as leader in the field of
applied machine learning and data visualization by developing, deploying, and scaling
reliable data solutions that inform decisions that address global poverty.

The DSE team, in partnership with other IPA functions, focuses on the following four
following workstreams:

## Data Infrastructure

DSE develops and maintains approaches to data that allow for greater efficiency in
learning from IPA's research and operational data. For this DSE partners closely with
the GRDS and MIST teams.

### Data Science and Machine Learning Capacity

DSE works to establish an industry-leading and persistent capacity to apply methods from
machine learning, causal inference, and data visualization to further IPA's mission to
discover and advance what works to improve the lives of people living in poverty.

### Data Products and Services

DSE supports the development of data applications and products that support
decision-making within IPA's programs and external partners.

### External Engagement

DSE strives elevate IPA's global profile to support evidence based policy through data
insights and ethics in machine learning and artificial intelligence for development.
